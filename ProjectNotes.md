With Firebase, its easy to set the cache for the serve

I've had the issue a few times where I get an error trying to deploy but get a successful deploy when immediately trying again. Not sure whats causing this...

It can sometimes take a little while to deploy but I believe this will get faster as Firebase Functions moves out of Beta.

I've experience blazing fast
